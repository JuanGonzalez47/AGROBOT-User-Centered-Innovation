AGROBOT: Applying Design Thinking to Innovate in Agriculture

Project Vision and Introduction

AGROBOT is a technological innovation project born from applying the Design Thinking methodology to solve real and pressing challenges in the agricultural sector. The goal is to design and develop an accessible, scalable robotics solution that improves operational efficiency, sustainability, and working conditions in farming, with an initial focus on the floriculture industry in Eastern Antioquia, Colombia.
This project goes beyond technology; it is a deep exercise in empathy, strategy, and user-centered validation. Its development is currently being carried out within the framework of the Research Group on Energy, Processes, and Agro-industry (GEPAR) at the University of Antioquia (UdeA), of which I am an active member.

Connection to Data Science:

The Design Thinking methodology was the cornerstone for defining the business questions and user needs. This process is analogous and fundamental to any data science project, as it allowed us to:

- Identify critical variables to monitor (e.g., humidity, pests).
- Define the necessary data to build a valuable solution.
- Establish the foundation for future predictive analytics and crop optimization models.

The Design Thinking Journey: Methodology in Action

The project was structured around the five iterative stages of Design Thinking, using strategic tools at each step to ensure the final solution was aligned with real-world needs.

- 2.1. Empathize: Understanding the Core Problem
  
  To gain a deep understanding of the farmers' needs, we used the following tools:
  Problem Tree Analysis: We identified that the core problem was a lack of monitoring, efficiency, and automation. This is caused by high technological costs and a scarcity of resources, leading to negative        effects like low productivity and crop loss.
  Empathy Map: We stepped into the shoes of agricultural workers. We discovered their main "pains" are physical and mental fatigue, pressure for precision, and monotony. Their desired "gains" include greater       accuracy, reduced physical effort, and the opportunity to learn new technologies.
  Idelfe Test & DISC Profiles: We assessed the initial business idea's viability and analyzed the team's strengths to effectively distribute roles, combining technical, strategic, and creative profiles.

- 2.2. Define: Focusing the Solution
  
  With the insights from the empathy phase, we clearly defined our target audience and value proposition:
  STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning): Our target market is the 141 flower-growing companies in Eastern Antioquia, of which 82 have expressed interest in adopting new technologies. AGROBOT is positioned     as an accessible and adaptable solution for this segment.
  Value Proposition Canvas: We connected customer needs (monitoring crops, optimizing resources) with our solution: an integrated hardware (rover, sensors) and software (app) platform that reduces workload,        provides early-risk alerts, and is user-friendly.
  Opportunity Canvas: We validated the business opportunity, confirming that the solution addresses a critical problem (manual selection of cuttings), is easy for workers with little tech experience to adopt,      and has a clear Return on Investment (ROI) in under a year.

- 2.3. Ideate: Exploring Possibilities
  We generated creative solutions and explored different angles for innovation:
  5 Whys & SCAMPER: These techniques helped us uncover the root cause of problems (low automation is due to a lack of access and resources) and re-imagine existing ideas (like adapting home automation sensors or   using solar power) to create an accessible solution.
  Doblin's 10 Types of Innovation: We determined that AGROBOT's value lies not only in the product (Offering) but also in its business model (Configuration) and customer experience (Experience), creating a more    defensible competitive advantage.

- 2.4. Prototype: Making Ideas Tangible
  We built various representations of the product to validate its technical feasibility and conceptual design.
  Functional Prototype (in progress): The initial physical assembly of the chassis, wheels, and base structure was completed.
  Conceptual & Schematic Prototype: Visual renderings and motor connection diagrams were created to validate the electronic design and communicate the concept.
  QFD (Quality Function Deployment) Matrix: We translated user needs into technical features. "Ease of use" (with 40% importance) emerged as the top user priority, guiding the design towards an intuitive           interface and both autonomous and manual navigation modes.

- 2.5. Test: Validating in the Real World
  Competitive Analysis: We researched patents, scientific articles, and business registries. We concluded that while other initiatives exist in Colombia, most are in early or academic stages. AGROBOT               differentiates itself through its scalable design, use of AI for data analysis, and a fully integrated hardware-software experience.
  Current Status & Next Steps (GEPAR - UdeA)
  Thanks to its solid methodological foundation, the AGROBOT project has been formally adopted by the GEPAR Research Group at the University of Antioquia.
  We are currently in the development phase of the functional prototype and validating the control and computer vision algorithms.
  
Next steps include:

- Sensor integration and development of the data visualization platform.
- Field tests with partner farms to gather direct user feedback.
- Development of an initial data model for crop performance analysis.
